project_1,"Guilherme Santos","{Arjun Kejriwal,John Doe}","Studying the crystallography of minerals in metamorphic rocks under varying pressure conditions."
project_2,"Ian Kamweru","{Abdul Rauf,Mary Jane}","The goal of this project is to identify the aluminosilicate (such as Kyanite and sillimanite) minerals within the rock. Further, we want to determine the relationship between these minerals and the surrounding minerals. Does it look like the aluminosilicates are breaking down? Are they growing?"
project_3,"Maria Rodriguez","{Sophia Johnson,Michael Smith}","Investigate the crystallographic structure of minerals found in volcanic rocks."
project_4,"David Brown","{Eva Wilson,Daniel Thompson}","Analyze the composition and distribution of trace elements in sedimentary rocks."
project_5,"Laura Martinez","{Ryan Miller,Olivia Davis}","Study the magnetic properties of minerals in metamorphic rocks."
