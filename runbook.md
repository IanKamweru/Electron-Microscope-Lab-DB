## **<u>Customer Notes</u>**

Imagine that all of the dummy data is the data collected on one sample, rock sample **21_GR_14Y**. So in this case, the project would have the following data:

**General Information**: The goal of this project is to identify the aluminosilicate (such as Kyanite and sillimanite) minerals within the rock. Further, we want to determine the relationship between these minerals and the surrounding minerals. Does it look like the aluminosilicates are breaking down? Are they growing?

**Supervising Professor**: T. Harms

**Student Researcher**: John Doe


### Sample (the physical object!):

<u>SampleID</u>: 21_GR_14Y

<u>Sampling Locality</u>: Montana

<u>Year Sampled</u>: 2021

<u>Notes</u>: Thin section billet was taken parallel to the foliation of the rock.

<u>Analyses Performed:</u>

***AxioImager***: Two full thin section maps were produced on the light microscope. PPL = plane polarized light; XPL = crossed polarized light. We use the different light settings to show different features of minerals. These are the maps that we make to have "roadmaps" for our scanning electron microscope (SEM) work!

***AxioScope***: small region of interest (ROI) inset maps taken on the light microscope to highlight where we want to work with the SEM

***OxfordSEM***: 

*Full thin section heat maps* --
Maps showing where there is a lot (bright) and a little (dark) of an element of interest. The SEM has to take lots of individual pictures then montage (or stitch) them together. Look for the files that are named something like "Al K series Montaged Map Data" to see the full thin section maps. I exported the metadata that is available as well.

*Site 7* --
This has some point data exported to show you what that looks like.

***ZeissSEM***:
We then use Mineralogic to ask really in depth questions about composition. The important exports that we use and look at are in "C-01ZoneTest2".
